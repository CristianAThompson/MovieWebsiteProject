#Movie Website

*This is a movie website built upon the foundation of Python programming language*

##How to Build and Access the Website
* Initially you will need to have Python installed: If it isn't click [here](https://www.python.org/downloads/)
* After successfully installing Python you can continue by downloading the folder by clicking [here](https://github.com/CristianAThompson/MovieWebsiteProject/archive/gh-pages.zip)
* Or if you have knowledge of git you can run `git clone https://github.com/CristianAThompson/MovieWebsiteProject.git`
* Once extracted or cloned navigate to the folder and double click the entertainment_center.py file
* A webpage will then automatically open containing the built webpage with movie trailer
* Locate the index.html file it creates and double click it to have it re-open the web page

##How it was designed
This was a project designed entirely in Python to show how to use arrays and iteration
to display objects based on the returned values. Paired with Bootstrap Modals it
smoothly displays Poster images with a description of each movie and on click
shows a modal with the trailer being presented. Each article also includes a link
to the imdb page. It not only automatially opens a web page containing the result
but it creates an index.html file to be accessed later that retains all the formatted
HTML/CSS/JS that was built within Python.
